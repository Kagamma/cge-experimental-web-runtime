Playground for testing various ideas for a potential Castle Game Engine web runtime.

Requires `npm` to be installed on the system.

- Install required packages: `npm i`
- For development & testing (localhost:8000): `npm run build-wasm && npm start`
- Build wasm binaries only: `npm run build-wasm`
- Deploy (result in `dist` directory): `npm deploy`
